# workout-tracker
I've developed an application that streamlines the process of tracking workouts and nutritional data. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

User-Friendly Input: The tracker accepts workout details in the user's preferred language. 🌐
Language Processing: Using the Nutritionix API, the input is translated into a standardized format, ensuring accuracy in data handling. 🔄
Data Storage: The processed data, including calories burned, is then seamlessly stored in a Google Sheet via the Sheety API. This makes it easy to review and analyze progress over time. 📈
